Keep the MTV aesthetic for the MTV menu
Create a layer that covers the screen till the videos start playing
Create a date/clock display
Create proper directories for each media
Filter video categories by tags

{
	"title": "Enjoy_Yoursef.mp4",
	"source": "/home/mairon/Desktop/Rasp/Media/Enjoy_Yoursef.mp4",
	"category": "mtv",
	"tag": "vaporwave",	 
	"era": "any"
}

"title" is the name of the file
"source" is the local path to the file 
"category" can be:
	"mtv"
	"vhs"
	"radio"
	it defines which page will load them
"tag" is used to filter content. Some examples:
	"vaporwave"
	"videoclip"
	"tvshow"
	"movie"
	"any"
	content can be filtered by name too, like:
		"bobross"
		"x-files"
		"simpsons"
		and will be show like that in a list to select a category
"era" is used to filter content by age.
	it makes more sense in the radio screen
	
The main feature is a random button. It must play anything.
	

Use Gamepad input
